### Approach to Solution

This project addresses two set of problems: 
- Which driver wins the second place in each Formula One race? and 
- Which constructor wins the Formula One Constructor Championship in each season?

The team is divided into two groups to focus on different set of problems. Team Guankun and Pruthvi worked on the driver's standing problem; Team Shen and Yixuan worked on the constructor champiosnship problem. 

Within each team, one student works on the inference model, the goal of which is to investigate the factors contributing to the defined result, whereas the other student works on the predictive model, the goal of which is to anticipate the defined result. 

The outcome of this project is in the report folder, where each student answers the pre-assigned questions and explain their insights.
