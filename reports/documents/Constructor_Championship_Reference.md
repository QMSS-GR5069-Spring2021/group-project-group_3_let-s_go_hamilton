### Constructor Championship Inference

- Describe the model, explain why each feature was selected
- Provide statistic that show how well this model fit the data
- What is the most important features? How is it determined?
- Provide some marginal effects for the variable you identified and interpret it in the context of f1 racing (story telling)
- Does it make sense to think of it as an explanation for why a constructor wins a season? Or is it simply association?
